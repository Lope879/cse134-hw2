            <h2>COGS108: Data Science in Practice</h2>
            <p>I collaborated with my team to perform a research paper using techniques such as web scraping to gather information in the internet and run analytics. 
                The focus of the research paper was  to identify if there was a correlation between population density and preference for fashion styles.</p>

            <h2>CSE110: Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>I was part of a team that collaborated to create a website about improving one's habits using a skill-tree type of tracking. My team focused on learning 
                and improving our knowledge of <span style="color: blue;">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span> to make the website. We would meet often to discuss our status.
